The aim is to create a program in C that reads from stdin and writes back to stdout replacing
every odd numbered ' with `. One naive solution follows:

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	char c;
	int i = 0;
	while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
		if (c == '\'') {
			if (i % 2 == 0)
				putchar('`');
			else
				putchar('\'');
			i++;
		} else
			putchar(c);
	}
	return 0;
}

Now, the fun begins when you try and do it using the least number of characters...
